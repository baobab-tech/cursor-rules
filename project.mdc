## Databases
This project uses:
1. supabase for the app data.
2. /db_data which has a drizzle setup and another remote database for data that is used by this app.

When to use what?
- Any data for web searches, knowledge searches etc, use the db_data
- Any user data, auth, tenant, user profile, web query caching use the supabase 

## Supabase data
- located in /lib/supabase
- most reusable queries are in queries.ts

## Data DB
- You import schema table types from '@datadb/schema'
- Use drizzle  
- The drizzle file is located in /db_data/schema.ts

To update the data db schema you edit the schema file then run `npx drizzle-kit push`
